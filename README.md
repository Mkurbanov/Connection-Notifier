# Connection Notifier
Just a *Python* script notifying about Internet connection.
We have a very poor internet connection, so I had to create this little script.

## Install
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Mkurbanov/Connection-Notifier.git
cd Connection-Notifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```cmd
py connection_notifier.py
```

## Example
```cmd
C:\Users\Mukam\Desktop\Connection-Notifier>py connection_notifier.py
is down!
is down!
is down!
is down!
